        <span style="font-weight:normal;"> For almost a decade, Ravi has been working to primarily do two things: launch and scale up non-profits to help those who are disadvantaged, and use civic technology to build products to increase access to information, openness and the use of data. Here are some selected projects: </br> </p>
<ul>

<li> <a href="http://www.codefornepal.org" target="blank"> Code for Nepal</a>: In 2014, with his wife Ravi co-founded Code for Nepal, a non-profit to increase digital literacy and the use of open data in Nepal. Ravi voluntarily leads Code for Nepal. Check out these products of Code for Nepal: <a href="http://www.nepalmap.org/" target="_blank">NepalMap</a>, <a href="https://asknepal.info" target="_blank"> AskNepal</a>, and <a href="http://rahatpayo.org" target="_blank"> RahatPayo. </a>

</li>

<li> Digital response to earthquake in Nepal: When earthquake hit Nepal, in 2015, Ravi, mobilized a digital response by working with volunteers around the world to connect relief providers and earthquake survivors. He also built one of the first district-level casualty map based on the data from the Government of Nepal. Read more about it on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/world/asia/3-ways-nepalis-are-using-crowdsourcing-to-aid-in-quake-relief.html?_r=0" target="blank"> New York Times </a>.</li>


<li> Bringing peace to protests: When Ravi visited his hometown in November 2015, he found months-long protest that had paralyzed town. To help opposing groups engage in a constructive and empathetic conversation, he organized a group to launch a viral campaign.

<li> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GMIN.Nepal/" target="blank">Grassroot Movement in Nepal (GMIN)</a> : In 2009, Ravi co-founded Grassroot Movement in Nepal to rebuild primary schools in remote parts of Nepal. He helped build chapters of the non-profit in the UK, and donor base worldwide. More than 25 schools have been rebuilt by the non-profit. </li>
